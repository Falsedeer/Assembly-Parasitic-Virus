# Assembly-Parasitic-Virus
Self-Designed MS-DOS Parasitic Virus Coded in TASM 
  
DESC:This virus is harmless, but will append it self after COM file to infect it.  
     Furthermore it will match the first 5 bytes in COM file to avoid re-infecction.  
     Those infected file won't be destroyed, but the file size would increase 300 ~ 400 bytes,  
     however the infected COM file will stay functional after execution.
